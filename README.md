# Tutorial 2D (Tut2D)

Tutorial 2D is exactly what it says on the tin. Based on Godot's "[Your first 2D game](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html)" tutorial. This one uses C# examples instead of GDScript. While I am familiar with Godot, I'm clueless on the C# APIs and that the programming language I'm most comfortable and familiar with.

## Requirements

- [Godot 4.1](https://godotengine.org/download)
- [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) 6 or later.
- IDEs or Editors
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
