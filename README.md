# Tutorial 2D (Tut2D)

Based on Godot's "[Your first 2D game](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html)" tutorial, Tutorial 2D is exactly what it says on the tin, but uses the C# examples instead. While I am familiar with GDScript and have used it on previous games, I am more comfortable with C#. This game aims to understand Godot's .NET APIs.
